# Naplug

*Naplug* is a [Nagios plugin](http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html) library for Ruby focused on plugin internals: organization, status, performance data (coming soon!), output and exit code handling. It does not implement any functionality related to option and argument parsing, as there are fine tools already available for this purpose. It aims to ease the task of writing Nagios plugins in Ruby and _handling the paperwork_, allowing the plugin developer to concentrate on the test logic of the plugin. Its internal design is largely modeled after the very excellent [Worlkflow](https://github.com/geekq/workflow) library.

*Naplug* introduces the concept of a *plug*, which is a useful abstraction to break up significant tasks that the plugin as a whole must perform in order to determine the state of a service or host. Plugs, like plugins, have status and output, which is used to determine the overall status of the plugin and build the output depending on said status.

While *Naplug* handles the nitty-gritty of Nagios plugins, it is important to have familiarity with the [Nagios Plugin Developer Guidelines](http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html).

At its core, a Nagios plugin is a program that evaluates test conditions and yields back status and output. 

## Overview

Naplug approaches Nagios plugins as Ruby classes. To use *Naplug*, install the gem and:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'naplug'
    
    class MyPlugin
      include Naplug
      plugin do |p|
        ...
      end  
    end
    
All examples will omit the `require`s for readability.
 
A very simple plugin that always returns an OK status:
    
    class AlwaysOkPlugin

      include Naplug

      plugin do |p|
        p.status.ok!
        p.output! "Optimism level: 100%"
      end
    end

    AlwaysOkPlugin.new.exec!

In the above example, a new class is defined (the class name is arbitrary), and within this class, a plugin is created, which performs some work to set the status and output of the plugin. Once the class is defined, a new instance of the plugin is created and executed. The `exec!` method runs the plugin, evaluates status, produces correctly formatted output, and exits with the appropriate exit code:

    naplug@plugin:~: alwaysok 
    OK: Optimism level: 100%
    naplug@plugin:~: echo $?
    0 

A less optimistic example, this time with arguments:

    class AlmostAlwaysOkPlugin

      include Naplug

      plugin do |p|

        p.output! "Optimism level: #{p[:optimism]}%"

        case p[:optimism]
          when 23..100 then p.status.ok!
          when 6..22   then p.status.warning!
          when 0..5    then p.status.critical!
          else
            p.output! "utterly confused"
        end

      end
    end

    plugin = AlmostAlwaysOkPlugin.new :optimism => Random.rand(100)
    plugin.exec!
    
Which yields:

    naplug@plugin:~: almostalwaysok 
    OK: Optimism level: 96%
    naplug@plugin:~: echo $?
    0
    
And

    naplug@plugin:~: almostalwaysok 
    WARNING: Optimism level: 9%
    naplug@plugin:~: echo $?
    1

## Plugins

As seen in the examples above, *plugins* are defined inside a new class with `plugin`. Plugins are always initialized with an `UNKNOWN` state and their output set to `uninitialized plugin`, since at that point, the status of the plugin has not been determined. This ensures that misbehaved plugins correctly notify Nagios that they are failing in some way (for instance, if there's an unhandled exception).

### Tags

Plugins can be tagged, and tags *must* be unique within a class. Tags are used to identify a plugin, which is useful in cases where multiple plugins are defined in a single class, which may be necessary in cases where multiple implementations of tests are required. A plugin's tag defaults to `main` when not specified.

Plugins can be accessed through _tag_ methods, and executed through _tag!_ methods.

    class MultiPlugin
    
      include Naplug
      
      plugin :foo do |p|
        ...
      end
    
      plugin :bar do |p|
        ...
      end
      
    end
    
    plugin = MultiPlugin.new
    case condition
      when true then plugin.foo!
      else plugin.bar!
    end
    
When defining multiple plugins, invoking `exec!` will execute the `main` plugin (if defined; otherwise, `exec!` is unable to decide which one to execute). When defining a single plugin, `exec!` will execute it regardess of tag.


### Arguments

A plugin can accept [mostly] arbitrary arguments, which are entirely optional and are available through the *[]* notation. *Naplug* (again, mostly) attaches no special meaning to them, i.e., they can be used in any way they need to be used.
    
A more realistic example that checks the staleness of a marker file:

    class MarkerFilePlugin

      include Naplug

      plugin do |p|
	      if Time.now - File.mtime(p[:marker_file]) > p[:critical]
	        p.status.critical!
	        p.output! "marker file #{p[:marker_file]} mtime greater than #{p[:critical]} seconds"
  	      else
  	        p.status.ok!
  	        p.output! "marker #{p[:marker_file]} is up to date"
  	      end
      end
    end

    plugin = MarkerFilePlugin.new :marker_file => '/tmp/my_marker', :critical => 120
    plugin.exec!    

The above example with some added flexibility and robustness:

    class MarkerFilePlusPlugin
    
      include Naplug
    
      plugin do |p|
        begin
          delta = Time.now - File.mtime(p[:marker_file])
          p.output! "marker file is %d seconds out of date" % [delta]
          case
            when delta < p[:w_seconds]
              p.status.ok!
              p.output! 'marker file %s is up to date' % [p[:marker_file]]
            when (p[:w_seconds]..p[:c_seconds]).include?(delta)
              p.status.warning!
            when delta >= p[:c_seconds]
              p.status.critical!
            end
          rescue Errno::ENOENT => e
            p.status.unknown!
            p.output! "marker file %s does not exist" % [p[:marker_file]]
            p.payload! e
          end
        end
      end
    end
    
    plugin = MarkerFilePlugin.new :marker_file => '/tmp/my_marker', :c_seconds => 120, :w_seconds => 60
    plugin.exec!

There are some worthwhile observations about the above example. A missing marker file prevents determining the stalesness of said file (infinite staleness?), resulting in an `UNKNOWN` status. Catching this is not strictly necessary, since plugins initially have a `UNKNOWN` status. There are however instances where it may be useful to specifically do this. Note that the entire exception object is available through the `payload`.

Arguments can also be specified via the `args!` method:

    class ArgumentsPlugin
    
      include Naplug
      
      plugin do |p|
        ...
      end
      
    end
    
    plugin = ArgumentsPlugin.new :instance => 1
    plugin.args! :instance => 2

### Plugs

Up until now, *Naplug* has essentially provided *syntactic sugar* to define and use plugins, along with some convenience methods to represent status and produce output. But plugins sometimes need to perform a number of possibly independent tasks to reach a final, _aggregated_ status. In *Naplug*, these tasks are referred to as *plugs*. They are essentially plugins, behave like plugins, but are scoped to a plugin.

When a plugin in created, we can define *plugs* inside the plugin through `plug` call. Like plugins, the can be tagged.

    class PlugPlugin
    
      include Naplug
    
      plugin do |p|
    
        plug :plug1 do |p1|
          ...
        end
      
        plug :plug2 do |p2|
          ...
        end
      
      end
    end

#### Arguments

With the introduction of plugs, arguments do become more structured, as arguments keys are matched to plugin and plug tags to route them appropriately.

    plugin = PlugPlugin.new(:plug1 => { :critical => 120, :warning => 60 },
                            :plug2 => { :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10 })

Any keys not matching plugin (and plug) tags are considered to be shared:

    plugin = PlugPlugin.new(:file => '/tmp/file',
	                        :plug1 => { :critical => 120, :warning => 60 }, 
                            :plug2 => { :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10 })
                                  
Tagged arguments have preference over shared ones.

    plugin = PlugPlugin.new(:file => '/tmp/file', 
                            :plug1 => { :file => '/var/tmp/file', :critical => 120 },
                            :plug2 => { :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10 })
                            
#### A Plugged Plugin Example

Take a service for which we wish to monitor three conditions:

* that the service is running one and only one process
* that the log file has seen activity within the last 60 seconds
* that some metric related to the service (number of files in a queue) is within acceptable thresholds

Each of these tasks can be a plug, and Naplug will take care of aggregating the statuses to yield a plugin status (worst always wins).

    require 'sys/proctable'
    require 'naplug'
    
    class MultiPlugServicePlugin
    
        include Naplug
        
        plugin do |p|
        
          plug :proc_count do |p1|
            pids = Sys::ProcTable.ps.each do |ps|...
            case pids.size
              when 1
                p1.status.ok
                p1.output "process #{p1[:name]} running with pid #{pids[0]}"
              when 0
                p1.status.critical
                p1.output "process #{p1[:name]} not running"
              else
                p1.status.critical
                p1.output "multiple #{p1[:name]} processes found, pids #{pids.join(',')}"
            end
          end
        
          plug :log_mtime do |p2|
            delta = Time.now - File.mtime(p2[:log_file])
            if delta > p2[:critical]
	            p2.status.critical
	            p2.output "p2[:name] log file #{p2[:log_file]} mtime greater than #{p2[:critical]} seconds"
  	          else
  	            p2.status.ok
  	            p2.output "marker #{p2[:log_file]} is up to date"
  	          end
          end
          
          plug :queue_depth do |p3|
            num_files = Dir.entries(p3[:dir]).length - 2
            p3.output "queue depth: #{num_files} items"
            
            case num_files
              when 0..100
                p3.status.ok
              when 101..1000
                p3.status.warning
              else
                p3.status.critical
             end          
          end
          
        end        
    end
    
    plugin = MultiPlugServicePlugin.new :name => 'foobard'
    plugin[:log_mtime] = { :log_file => '/var/log/foobard.log' }
    plugin[:queue_depth] = { :dir => '/var/spool/foobard' }
    plugin.exec!

## Naplug Methods

Whenever Naplug in included in a class, several methods are available:

* `args` and `args!` to retrieve and set arguments
* `exec!`, `exec` and `eval` to exec-to-exit, exec and evaluate

In addition to the above methods, plugins and plugs provide the following ones:

* `has_plugs?`, which evaluates to true if a plugin has plugs
* `[]` and `[]=` to get and set specific arguments
* `status` to get a plugin or plug status
* `output` and `output!` to get and set plugin and plug output
* `payload` and `payload!` to get and set plugin and plug payload (used to carry exceptions)

Overriding these will likely cause *Naplug* to misbehave, to say the least.
     
### Status

Status is a special object that represent the status of a plugin for each of the defined states in the [Nagios Plugin Guidelines](http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html): `OK`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL` and `UNKNOWN`. Each of these states is itself an instance method which sets the state, and you can obtain the string and numeric representation through the usual methods `to_s` and `to_i`. The initial (and default) status of a `Status` object is `UNKNOWN`. Statuses are comparable in that larger statuses represent worse states, a feature that will come handy shortly.

    require 'naplug/status'

    puts "All statuses:"
    Naplug::Status.states.each do |state|
      status = Naplug::Status.new state
      puts "  status #{status} has exit code #{status.to_i}"
    end

    puts "Working with a status:"
    status = Naplug::Status.new
    puts "  status #{status} has exit code #{status.to_i}"
    status.ok
    puts "  status #{status} has exit code #{status.to_i}"
    
    puts "Comparing statuses:"
    status1 = Naplug::Status.new :warning
    if status < status1
      puts "  status [#{status}] < status1 [#{status1}] is true"
    end

which produces

    naplug@plugin:~: status 
    All statuses:
      status OK has exit code 0
      status WARNING has exit code 1
      status CRITICAL has exit code 2
      status UNKNOWN has exit code 3
    Working with a status:
      status UNKNOWN has exit code 3 after initialization
      status OK has exit code 0 after status.ok
    Comparing statuses:
      status [OK] < status1 [WARNING] is true
