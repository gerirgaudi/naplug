# naplug

*Naplug* is a Nagios plugin library for Ruby. In its current incantation it really concerns itself only with internal aspects of a plugin (i.e., handling status, output and exit codes) vs external aspects (such as option parsers), which will likely be a future feature.

## Anatomy of a Nagios Plugin

Before writing a plugin, you should read the [Nagios Plugin Developer Guidelines](http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html). *Naplug*â€™s aim is to codify said guidelines to ease the task of writing a plugin in Ruby and _handling the paperwork_. It also aids in writing more complex plugins by allowing _subplugins_ (i.e., plugins within plugins, which produce results that are then evaluated as a whole to generate a _global_ plugin result).

### Results

In Naplug, a plugin (and its associated subplugins) produce `Result`s, which encapsulate useful bits of information about the state of the plugin before and after execution, including *status*, *output* and *payload*. All `Result`s start their life with an `UNKNOWN` status.

A `Status` has both a numeric and string representation. The numeric representation is useful to produce the correct exit code and generate the appropiate output.

## Overview

A minimal (and admittedly not very useful) example:

    require 'naplug'
    
    class MyPlugin << Nagios::Plugin
    end
    
This, of course, isn't really enough. The plugin needs work to do, which can be accomplished by defining the plugin through the `plugin` method, which must always return a `Result`. Take, for example, a plugin that checks the staleness of a marker file: 

    require 'naplug'

	class MarkerFilePlugin < Nagios::Plugin

  	  plugin do |args|
  	    result = Result.new
	    if Time.now - File.mtime(args[:marker_file]) > args[:critical]
	      result.status = :critical
	      result.output = 'marker mtime greater than 60 seconds'
  	    else
  	      result.status = :ok
  	      result.output = 'marker up to date'
  	    end
 	    result
      end
	end

	plugin = MarkerFilePlugin.new :marker_file => '/tmp/my_marker', :critical => 120
	plugin.exec!    

A `plugin` can be defined in an aribitrary fashion, accepting whatever arguments are necessary. Let's make the above example a little more flexible and robust:

    require 'naplug'

	class MarkerFilePlugin < Nagios::Plugin

  	  plugin do |args|
        result = Result.new
        begin
          delta = Time.now - File.mtime(args[:marker_file])
          result.output = 'marker file is %d seconds out of date' % [delta]
          case
            when delta < args[:w_seconds]
              result.status = :ok
              result.output = 'marker file %s is up to date' % [args[:marker_file]]
            when (args[:w_seconds]..args[:c_seconds]).include?(delta)
              result.status = :warning
            when delta >= args[:c_seconds]
              result.status = :critical
          end
        rescue Errno::ENOENT => e
          result.status = :unknown
          result.output = 'marker file %s does not exist' % [args[:marker_file]]
          result.payload = e
        end
        result
      end
    end

    plugin = MarkerFilePlugin.new :marker_file => '/tmp/my_marker', :c_seconds => 120, :w_seconds => 60
    plugin.exec!

Some interesting observations about the above code:

* The case where the marker file is missing is handled, resulting in an `unknown` status
* The exception is saved as the `result.payload`, in case this is useful to the caller
* The `exec!` call is used, which instructs the plugin to execute, output and exit in a single call

### Helpers

Plugins sometimes need helpers, and this can be accomplished by defining `private` methods in the class, which can then be used by the plugin. `Nagios::Plugin` does not enforce the privacy of the said helpers, but it's good form to make them so.
   
    class HelpedPlugin < Nagios::Plugin
    
      plugin do |args|
        size, mtime = file_mtime_and_size(args[:market_file]
        ... 
      end
      
      private
      
      def file_mtime_and_size(file)
        fs = File.stat(file)
        return fs.size,fs.mtime
      end
      
    end
     
### Sub-plugins
 
Plugins sometimes need to perform a number of tasks to reach a final, _aggregated_ status of the check. This could be done in a single `plugin` block, but it is far cleaner to define multiple `plugins` and let `Nagios::Plugin` do the aggregation work, which essentially consists of finding the worst `Result`.

When `plugin` is called as shown in the examples above, an implicit _tag_ `main` is created for the plugin. Said tags can, however, be explicitly defined, which is handy with sub-plugins in order to pass them the right set of arguments:

    require 'naplug'
    
    class MultiPlugin < Nagios::Plugin
    
      plugin :subplug1 do |args|
        ...
      end
      
      plugin :subplug2 do |args|
        ...
      end
      
    end
    
Plugin tags are used internally to keep track of different bits of data relevant to each sub-plugin. On the outside, tags are how arguments are passed on to the appropriate sub-plugin:

	multiplugin = MultiPlugin.new(:subplug1 => { :critical => 120, :warning => 60 }, 
                                  :subplug2 => { :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10 })

When the plugin is instantiated, an argument key that matches a sub`plugin` tag is assumed to contain arguments for said subplugin.

#### Shared Arguments

In some cases, it may be desirable to provide shared arguments. This is done by passing arguments keys that do not match any of the subplugin tags.

	multiplugin = MultiPlugin.new(:shared => '/tmp/file',
	                              :subplug1 => { :critical => 120, :warning => 60 }, 
                                  :subplug2 => { :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10 })


Thus, when the actual calls are made, the argument hashes are merged. Thus, in the above example, the following calls will take place:

    plugin_subplug1 :shared => '/tmp/file', :critical => 120, :warning => 60

and

    plugin_subplug2 :shared => '/tmp/file', :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10

Arguments can be overwritten:

    multiplugin = MultiPlugin.new(:shared => '/tmp/file', 
                                  :subplug1 => { :shared => '/var/tmp/file', :critical => 120 },
                                  :subplug2 => { :ok => 0, :warning => 5, :critical => 10 })
